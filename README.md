# Cats-and-Dogs-classifier
In this project, we performed classification task using the cats and dogs dataset downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data. To classify the cats and dogs images, we used the convolutional neural network. The pytorch library was used to implement the convolutional neural network. First, we implemented a simple convolutional neural network with two layers and later we added two more layers to make the network deep.
