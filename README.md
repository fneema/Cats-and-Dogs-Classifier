# Cats-and-Dogs-classifier
In this project, we performed classification task using the cats and dogs dataset downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data. To classify the cats and dogs images, we used convolutional neural network. The aim of this project was to build a simple convolution neural network and then modify it to a mutlilayer convolutional neural network. Note that we are not concerned about the accuracy of the models here, we just need to know how to build a mutlilayer convolutional neural network from a simple convolutional neural network. Later, we will see how to improve the accuracy of the networks. Pytorch library was used to implement the convolutional neural network. First, we implemented a simple convolutional neural network with two layers and later we added two more layers to make the network deep.
The jupiter notebook shows how full connected layer neural network is implemented. It also includes the simple convolutional neural network and the multilayer convolutional neural network.
